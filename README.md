Card-Ceck
=========

After having spent some time thinking about how I would like to tackle this game "in some way that you care about", I was thinking, what could I do with the time I have to change this simple poker game into something I really would enjoy.

It hit me like a ton of bricks, CHANGE THE GAME!

Andrew and I had been talking earlier in the day about the fact that playing the game "cards against humanity" was a pretty good way of getting to know someone. So here it is:

-Very simply I took a screenshot of the open sourced C.A.H. question cards and made it the background, (that way if you play with multiple people you have the option of having a few fill in the blanks.)

I then took a screenshot of 52 of the answer cards and changed their names to match the input already in the games algorithm.

Once all the cards were in play and the background was set-up I used the Helvetica font (same as used in the games cards) to create my hold, deal, and draw buttons within the table (fairly crudely, this is where I started to get tired.)

If I get more time in the future I will definitely smooth out the look and feel of the page, and I would like to put all of the data into skeleton instead of table, it looks messy and feels clunky.
